// flowcharts are diagrammatic illustration to a given problem, they allow you to break a large problem into smaller steps and display then in a visually   appealing way

// pseudo code is the human readable description of the algorithm
// uses of pseudo code :
// 1. language independent
// 2. fastest way to structure the code
// 3. you can get reviews from anyone on your code

// how to write pseudo code :
/*
input - read n
assignment - sum = 0
output - print sum
if-else
  - if i<n then ... end else then ,,, end
while
  - while i>n do ... end
exit the program - exit
*/
// algorithm is the set of instruction followed to solve a particular problem
