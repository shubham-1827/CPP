// single inheritance example
//ðŸ”¸ Question:
//Create a Person class with attributes like name and age. Then create a Student class that inherits from Person and adds roll_number and marks.
//Write a program to input and display all the details of a student.

//ðŸ§  Goal: Understand how a child class reuses and extends a parent class.
class Person {

  string name;

// Multi level inheritance example
// ðŸ”¸ Question:
// Create a class Person, derived class Employee, and further derived class Manager.
// Each class should add some specific data (name, salary, department).
// Write a function to display complete info for a Manager object.

// ðŸ§  Goal: Practice the chain of inheritance where one class inherits from another which itself is a derived class.

// Question:
// Create a class Writer (with writing_speed) and another class Reader (with reading_speed).
// Then create a class Scholar that inherits from both.
// Initialize the data and display reading and writing speeds of the scholar.

// Goal: Understand how a class can inherit from multiple base classes and manage data from both.
